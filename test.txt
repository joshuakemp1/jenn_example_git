hey jennifer


here are the commands:

from the repo
do 

git init

git status - to see your work
make chagnes to your script


THEN do this

git add .


git commit -m "hey this is my first commit"

NOW go to github and create the repo that you want to push to for example

now add the remote lines:  it looks like this::

git remote add origin https://github.com/joshuakemp1/jenn_example_git.git  - difffernt than this though


Tell local git on your machine where to ALWAYS push your code for this repo:
git push -u origin master


check what files you are pushing with 

git status

git push - since you told it where to go you can simply push




DONE!
